# Restaurant Dashboard

## About :

This is a small project I was working on and contains a 
dashboard made using python, flask and bootstrap. I used an open 
source POS software for restaurants : Floreant POS, to artificially
generate data and have given some suitable plotting functions to
generate plots for which I have used plotly. 

I created the data used here by sitting and spending time on the above
mentioned software and actually placing orders. It was fun and a 
little irritating but I wasn't able to find raw POS data anywhere on 
the net and thus, this seemed like a good idea.

## Requirements :

1. flask
2. plotly
3. pandas
