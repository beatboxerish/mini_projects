# Mini Projects

This contains some mini projects/challenges that I encountered while learning 
some particular skill. These definitely don't need their own repos and thus
 have been clubbed into one sigle repo.
Examples would be using keras on inbuilt datasets or basic statistical tests
 on a dataset.

**Following are the projects in this repository:** 

1. Restaurant Dashboard: A simple dashboard made using python, flask and 
bootstrap.
